          First of all, the programming is a mess.<br>

          <img src="assets/mess.png" alt="toxic pool" />

          When I first began to learn how to code I began by taking a course
              at codecademy, started with some HTML/CSS.<br>

          <em>Cool.</em><br>

          Tags, attributes, selectors, hey I’m getting pretty good at this!<br>

          <em>Cool.</em><br>

          Finished that, next course: Javascript.<br>

          <em>Cool.</em><br>

          I did this in high-school. Loops, conditions, functions… Hey this
              isn’t too bad!<br>

          <strong>Finished.</strong><br>

          I was feeling pretty good at this point…<br>

          <strong>Until I actually wanted to create something.</strong><br>

          Funny enough I found out that this is pretty much why the industry
          changes so often.

          <p class="para">
            Programming languages, frameworks, libraries, algorithms, data
                structures, databases…<br>

            And those are just the TOOLS.<br>

            Then you have authentication, sessions, cookies, caching, server
                requests, parsing data…<br>

            <em>Oh. My. God.</em><br>

            I fell into what is known as “informed pessimism”.<br>

            How am I going to learn all of this?<br>

            Well I’ve spent a long time in the “Valley of Despair”, but what I
              realize about programming is that even people who have been doing
              this for 7 years are still learning <strong>everyday!</strong>

            Learning is to be expected and it can become one of the most
              fulfilling and fun parts of programming.<br>

            Things chance very quickly, but thankfully, so can our brains.<br>

            <strong>And so today I will give you some resources to help you add
              learning to your skills.</strong>

          <p class="para">

            When you recall something like a memory your brain sends
              electrical pulses between neurons.<br>

            These electrical pulses travel through what is known as
              neural pathways to get to each other.<br>

            The stronger these pathways are the quicker you are able to remember
            and understand something.
